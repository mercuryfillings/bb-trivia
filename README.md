STEP 2: Pitch Your Project
Before you start any actual coding, you must meet with your Squad Leader for ~10 minutes to get your app idea approved. Prepare the following materials before your meeting and put them in your README.md:

App Title: The name of your app.
App Description: What your app will do.
API: The API you are using and the information you plan to get from it.
API Snippet: A sample snippet of JSON from a successful GET request you have made to your API using Postman.
Wireframes: The proposed layout and design of your app. Create mockups for multiple views, including both desktop and mobile formats, and consider whether or not you need to account for landscape and portrait orientations.
MVP: A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.
Post-MVP: A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.
Goals: What you plan to accomplish for each day of the project week.
Priority Matrix: A graph of your intended areas of development (Pseudocoding, Design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Testing, etc) plotted on an X/Y axis where X represents time to completion and Y represents priority.
Timeframes: How long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

STEP 3: Make a New Repo
Make a new enterprise GitHub repo for your project. DO NOT FORK THIS REPO.
This new repo should be under your Enterprise Github, not your personal account.
Make sure your new repo is set to "Public" and initialize it with a README.md file.
Send a link for your repository to your Squad Leader.
Clone this new repository down to your machine.
CD into the project directory and touch index.html, style.css and script.js files.
Test a commit and push it to make sure everything is connected with git commit -m "first commit".
Note: Your repository should not be called project-1! Think of a name for your application, and then name your repository after your application.

STEP 4: ðŸ”´ Build Your Project MVP â€” Mandatory To Pass
Your application must meet these requirements:
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc), using at least one media query.
Deployed to a site hosting service like surge.sh.
Commits to GitHub every day.
A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i.
ðŸ“‹ List of APIs
Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free APIs you can use. There are many APIs out there, however, so if you find one not on this list, feel free to use it. No matter what API you decide on, make sure you can successfully make a GET request before you commit to using it.

Star Wars: https://swapi.co/
Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api

Rick and Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
This site lists a collection APIs as well. Take a look through their libraries and try to find one that interests you. Please note, however, that many APIs will require an authentication key, and some APIs require payment. We highly suggest using a free API for your first project dealing with one.
